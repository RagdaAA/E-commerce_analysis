### Overall trends
Analysis of sales and order count over time shows a consistent seasonal pattern across all years. Sales and order volume typically decline in between Q3 and Q4 followed by a recovery. The strongest increase occurring towards Q1-Q2. Notably, this seasonal pattern persists even during the sales surge observed in 2020, indicating that the dips are structural rather than event-driven. This suggests that proactive, time-targeted marketing campaigns ahead of these periods could help mitigate recurring declines.
